#### Task

Your mission, if you choose to accept it is to write an application that when given a house price should calculate the cost of stamp duty they should pay.


#### More Info

Stamp duty is the tax you pay when buying a house, it works a lot like income tax and is in bands.


|Property cost                                                |Stamp Duty Rate|
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|Up to £125,000                                               |Zero|
|The next £125,000 (the portion from £125,001 to £250,000)    |2%  |
|The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000)    |5%  |
|The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million)|10% |
|The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)        |12% |

#### Example
If you buy a house for £275,000, the Stamp Duty you owe is calculated as follows:

    0% on the first £125,000 = £0
    2% on the next £125,000 = £2,500
    5% on the final £25,000 = £1,250
    Total = £3,750
